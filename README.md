# 🩸 Anemia Prediction from Eye Images

A Flask web application that predicts **anemia** using **machine learning** by analyzing eye images uploaded by users. The model is trained to detect signs of low hemoglobin levels based on visual cues in the eye region.

## 📷 How It Works

1. User uploads a clear image of their eye.
2. The image is preprocessed and extract RGB values from the conjunctiva region and fed into a trained ML model (e.g., RandomForest).
3. The model predicts whether the person is likely anemic or not.
4. The result is displayed instantly on the webpage.

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Image Handling:** OpenCV / Pillow
